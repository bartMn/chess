The project is in an early stage. Currently it is possible to move all pices, capture enemy pices and promote a pawn to a queen (it is planned to add a choice but in majority a pawn is promoted to a queen, so currently it is not necessary). However, the following rules have not been done yet: castling, en passsant, checks, check mate and stalemate.
After all rules are implemented it is planned to make an AI for chess.

To make the program run, please add folder "pices" to the same repository. The folder contains two folders: "set0" (it contains patterns of pices) and "temp" (it is empty and when the program runs, balck and white pices are stored there. When the program terminates, items in the folder are deleted).

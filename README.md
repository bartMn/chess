The project is in an early stage. Currently it is possible to move all pices, capture enemy pices and promote a pawn to a queen (it is planned to add a choice but in majority a pawn is promoted to a queen, so currently it is not necessary). However, the following rules have not been done yet:
1. castling
2. en passsant
3. checks, check mate and stalemate
After all rules are implemented it is planned to make an AI for chess.
